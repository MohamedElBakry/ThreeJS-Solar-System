# ThreeJS-Solar-System

This is another of my final year univerity projects. It features the use of ThreeJS, a JavaScript library for perfomrant 3D rendering in the browser,
thanks to it being built on WebGL. As the name suggest, this project offers an educational experience of our Solar System's planets, featuring a few factoids.

  1. Download
